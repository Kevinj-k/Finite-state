# Finite-state
Finite state machine built in HTML

I decided to make a choose your own adventure game within HTML. The framework is compiled of links throughout HTML and some images to emulate a choose your own adventure game in HTML. All this is run through VS code as it seemed the simplest way to set up HTML, as I can just drop the HTML file into my browser and then reload it as I save to see the new changes. Each node is stored in an attribute <a> </a> for the links and <img> tags for the images. As you see the links with choices you can click on them to send you to another HTML page. I was able to relearn and learn core HTML concepts. Things like terms, how tags work, and the boilerplate code. I'm proud just getting all run together and being able to reliably put the code together. As it just feels good to remember the core concepts and put it together. I would like to implent more things like CSS an try to get things like Flexbox down and what not. Just overall making the HTML page actually look nice and not just white with some pictures to hyper links. Overall it was fun to put together even if base HTML itself is not that interesting by itself.
